# Sushi
Welcome to my Sushi App! This applcation allows you to submit a request to add some of your favorite sushi rolls. Once you order your roll it will display on the ordered list. The roll will populate with an attached "devoured" button that allows the user to click on it. Once the devoured button is clicked the roll moves to the "demolished" roll list. This indicates that the roll no longer exists. You are able to completely remove the roll from the webpage once it goes to the demolished list, simply by clicking the trash button.
